    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>At the time of my writing this, I am a 19-Year-Old Canadian with an Italian background. My pronouns are he/him. I'm also currently a second-year university student majoring in Computer Science. </p>
    <h2>My Mission:</h2>
    <p id="big-first-letter">
    My mission has been and always will be to spread kindness, positivity, love and support to everyone.
    I also advocate for justice and morality every day, striving for a better tomorrow with an esteemed sense of optimism.
    As we all know, the internet contains too much negativity, hatred and toxicity. 
    Once I found my calling, I realized just how devastating an impact these influences can have on us.
    My conscience knows that I shouldn't tolerate this as the norm. Everyone who seeks love and acceptance deserves to be treated as such. 
    That's why I began becoming a positive online influencer. I will commit to carrying forth this mission and support as many people as I can until the day I die.
